The Java new keyword is used to create an instance of the class. In other words, it instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory. We can also use the new keyword to create the array object.

There are three different types of variables a class can have in Java are local variables, instance variables, and class/static variables.

Ans 4.


Instance variable-:  An instance variable is a variable that is declared in a class but outside a method.
